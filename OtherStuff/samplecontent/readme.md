# sample content

I have found that Sherlock Holmes (which are in public domain) are the best source of unlimited amount of text that can be used as content for web programming practice. 

the best source is this - https://sherlock-holm.es/ 

I have also included PDF copies in this folder, if you dont want to get the content online for some reason. 

Of course, you can use any content you want. I am putting this here, for the sake of convenience.
