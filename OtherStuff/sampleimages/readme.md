# sample images

at the end of the day, web pages are nothing but content - mostly images and text content. I put together some ready to use images (cropped and reduced in size) to go with the chapters. 

Of course, you can use any images you want. I am putting this here, for the sake of convenience.

# images sets

* [beach set](beach) - I always liked the beaches of the world. some photos featuring beaches.
* i might add more images sets as the tutorial is built

# image sources

* i mostly use unsplash - https://unsplash.com/ - as it gives good quality images which are free to use for any purpose.
* the file name of the photo contains the user name of the person who made the photo. if you want more photos of that user or wish to thank that person, best to do a search for the user name, obtained from the photo name, on the unsplash website.
* i have included three sizes. regular size. small size (50 % of the regular size) and micro size (25 % of the regular size). Depending on how you want to layout your site, you use the appropriate size.
