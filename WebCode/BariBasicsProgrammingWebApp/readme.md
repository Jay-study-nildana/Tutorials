# Bari Basics Programming Web App

This is a simple app that is used to demonstrate all the basic web app skills that were learnt in these basic web programming tutorials.

# what does the app do?

Here is a list of things the app does, all the while, consuming the API mentioned below..

* register for a new accont
* login to the account
* add new entries of education
* update existing entries of education
* see the education entries already added

# missing feature

If you check the API code, linked below, you will notice that the API used currently does not allow deleting of entries. Hence, the web app, does not have any feature to delete entries related to education.

# Primary Focus

These are the things this web app focuses on

* use basic HTML
* use basic CSS
* use basic JavaScript
* use basic bootstrap (so that the app is mobile friendly, responsive design)
* consume a basic API, login and logout, collect authentication token
* consume a basic API, perform authenticated, token based CRUD (create, read, update and delete) using API endpoints

# running instructions - local computer

* assuming that you already have http-server node js package installed.
* http-server
* visit the website, for example, like this, http://192.168.0.195:8080/index.html
* if you forget index.html, some browsers might give error

# deployment

* deploy as you would deploy a standard web app. Filezilla, Docker, CICD. Its up to you.

# API server used

As of now, the web consumes the API server currently deployed at - https://baribasicsapiserverjune21st2020.azurewebsites.net
