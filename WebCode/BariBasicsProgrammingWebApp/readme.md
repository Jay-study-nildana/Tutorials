This is a simple app that is used to demonstrate all the basic web app skills that were learnt in these basic web programming tutorials.

# Primary Focus

These are the things this web app focuses on

* use basic HTML
* use basic CSS
* use basic JavaScript
* use basic bootstrap (so that the app is mobile friendly, responsive design)
* consume a basic API, login and logout, collect authentication token
* consume a basic API, perform authenticated, token based CRUD (create, read, update and delete) using API endpoints

# running instructions - local computer

* assuming that you already have http-server node js package installed.
* http-server
* visit the website, for example, like this, http://192.168.0.195:8080/index.html
* if you forget index.html, some browsers might give error

# deployment

* deploy as you would deploy a standard web app. Filezilla, Docker, CICD. Its up to you.
