# My Developer Story - How did I Learn?

In one of my classes, this question came up. How did I learn? 

For some reason, this never occured to me to put it here, in my textbook. However, I have had students ask about this multiple times, so, putting it here. 

It all started back when I was in school. Jurassic Park (the very first one) had just been released in our town of Mysore. Like so many people, I was blown away by the graphics of the movie. I was also very impressed with what computers can do, like that scene when that girl uses the computer to secure the facility. I told myself, I should try and become like that girl. A computer work person, when I grow up. 

Later, when I watched the movie, The Matrix, I was convinced, I will grow up to be a software developer or trainer or something in the software industry. Now, as I type this, I have been in the industry, professionally for over 8 years. 

I started by learning C. I remember, one of my older cousins, handed me over a book called "Let Us C". I started using that to learn the basics. Unfortunately, I never liked that book. I found the presentation in the book clunky, and the language not really up to my standards. Eventually, I joined college, and started referring to dozens of books, manuals, printed notes and the internet to learn C Programming. Even today, I have this habit of not learning from one single source of knowledge. I always end up using multiple resources, cross referencing knowledge and building my own 'virtual' textbook in my head. 

So, C programming is where I started. It was also around this time, I found out that, as far as I am concerned, my faculties and teachers have failed me. I tried learning in class and by listening to teachers. Unfortunately, I could not jive with them, and eventually, decided to self learn C programming, on my own. This also set a precedence. Since that time, till today, I always learn on my own without taking guidance from any teacher. 

After C, I picked up C ++, using the same self learning techniques, becoming something of an expert before I moved to MBA. By this time, I had decided that I dont want to be an office employee. I learnt how to run a business. Years went by, and in 2012, I had enough experience and maturity, to start my own software development and trainer business, working from home. 

From 2012, and as I type this, I now know how to code and develop in dozens of languages. I already knew C and C ++. Then, I upgraded to C #. After that, I learnt Java. Then, I moved to learn web programming (HTML, CSS and JS) and learnt dozens of JS libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery and even React. I learnt how to develop on multiple platforms. I first became well wersed with .NET, and then picked up Android. Then, I learnt how to build iOS apps. Even that was not enough, I learnt how to code on Node JS. 

Meanwhile, as the world moved on to the cloud, I also learnt how to run and build everything on Azure, acquiring expertise there as well. 

All in all, for a few years now, I have been self-titling myself as a 'Software Architect', as I have the ability to take an idea (from myself, or a client) and convert that into a fully functioning app backed by a API/backend server, all by myself. 

That is my story.
