# Flexbox

Flexbox is what you will probably end up using almost all the time, of all the different types of layout options available in CSS. 

You know what? I thought I will go into detail on this but, I dont want to do this. I mean, CSS stuff. Do what I would normally do, if I really have to do CSS.

* know the basics. that is already covered in the chapters till now. 
* go to the bootstrap website and use all the ready made code blocks and layouts that are built by people who are far better than you and me at CSS
* buy a bootstrap template. It will cost you anywhere from 10 $ to $100 and you get easy developer access
* just hire a CSS expert and you focus on the rest of the code building. 
* head over to stack overflow. CSS has been ripped apart and put together for decades.
* if you really want to, check out the below linked Firefox MDN learning links.

Again, sorry about this, but CSS just never interested me. They are simply too many things going on in CSS since the web was created.
