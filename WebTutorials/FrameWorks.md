# Understand FrameWorks like jQuery and React JS and React Native

Nowhere in this textbook, have I mentioned much about jQuery, React JS, Vue, Flutter or any of these 'advanced' javascript libraries. 

One main reason is that, my plan is to teach only the basics. 

The other reason is, these are frameworks. I like to think of frameworks as ready to use packages that have built in facilities to do things that are common for all web apps. They also come with them, a lot of optimization and bug fixes, which makes it easy to build apps at a less time. 

A quick example is, when you have to decided between 'buying a pizza' and 'making your own pizza' for a party. 

*If you decide to make your pizza, you get to do it the way you like it, with the ingredients you want, at your size, style and so on. However, this also means, you will spend a lot of time, making the pizza and less time, planning your party. Also, the pizza may not exactly turn out to be good.
* If you order pizza, one, you are guaranteed to get a well made pizza. Second, it saves you time, so you can focus on your main work, planning your party. 

Similarly, when building your web app (like your party), you could all your time focusing on HTML, CSS and JS, or, you could use a framework and make your life easy. 

# So, I dont have to learn the basics?

Well, that is where I will give you another metaphor. You cannot run before you walk. Running is like using the above mentioned frameworks. Walking is knowing the basics. Running is using the frameworks.

So, you learn how to walk, by learning the basics. 

Then, you go run at full speed, by picking up the framework.
