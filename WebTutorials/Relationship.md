# Understand Relationship Between HTML, CSS and JS

Now that we are learning the basics (and not one of the advanced JS frameworks like React or Vue), you will constantly hear about HTML, CSS and JS. 

Let's understand there relationsihp here. Let me think of an example of an animal. Think of a dog, dinosaur or even, yourself, a human being. 

We can break down an animal into three parts. 

* skeleton which gives the structure. 
* muscle and skin, hair, clothes which give the appearance
* the brain, which makes all the skeleton and muscle work, leading to actions and intelligence.

Drawing a comparison, this is how, I would frame the three things into. 

* skeleton which gives the structure. - HTML
* muscle and skin, hair, clothes which give the appearance - CSS (stylesheet)
* the brain, which makes all the skeleton and muscle work, leading to actions and intelligence. (JavaScript)

When building a web app using the essential concepts of HTML, CSS and JS, 

* you start by building out a structure using HTML
* then, you spruce up your HTML, and give it responsive design and appearance and style using CSS and Bootstrap
* then, you write actions in terms of functions and make calls to API and other data connections, build out HTML DOM elements using JavaScript, giving it intelligence
* You keep repeating these three steps until you have built the app you want.

That, in essence, is how, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, are related to each other.
