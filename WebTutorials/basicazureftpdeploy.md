# Basic Azure FTP Deploy

Ultimately, once you build your web app (even something as simple as javascript that swaps two images, as you saw in the javascript example in the previous chapter), the fun is to show it others. Once you start building your apps, you will need to host your web app in a web app server. 

There are many ways to deploy your web app code to your web app server. In this chapter, you will see how to 

* create a simple web app aka web server in your azure cloud account
* upload your web app code files to this web server. 

Obviously, I am assuming that you already have the following. 

* an Azure account that allows you to create resources that you need.
* FileZilla software. Just bing or google it, and install it on your computer.
* Of course, visual studio code. This is not mandatory, as you can take the files directly from codepen and put it on your server. 

I do understand that you may not have an Azure account for any number of reasons. If so, you can skip this chapter. It is not entirely essential that you learn about deployment right away. 

For this, you will just have to watch the video and see the action happen. We will be using the codepen link below as our example web app.
