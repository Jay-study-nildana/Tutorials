# Basic CSS

CSS is something that is in itself a complex topic. In this chapter, and in most chapters in this entire textbook, I wont be spending too much time on CSS.

That is because of the following reasons.

* I personally dont like CSS because it is so complex.
* Fortunately, bootstrap takes care of all the CSS problems, so we, developers can focus on doing our work. Our work being, building good web apps.
* a lot of things that you do in CSS, positioning, alinging, making things appear smaller or bigger and all that jazz, its done by bootstrap. So, personally, I dont like manipulating CSS too much unless it is absolutely neccessary. 
* for beginner level, you can manage with knowing only the basics of CSS and still build good web apps.

Some things to remember

* most of the time, you will end up using CSS classes in your web app.
* you will get CSS classes from your style library like bootstrap or any other style library that you are using.
* you can also build your own CSS classes by including your own CSS files
* you will also be using selectors to select a specific element or div or section or an entire page of the html page, and then apply CSS classes
* as I am only going to touch the essentials only here, I recommend that you check the linked mozilla page under references to get more details. 

Still, check the linked codepen below for some essential CSS usage.
