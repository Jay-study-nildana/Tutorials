# Basic HTML tags

Every HTML page (no matter how advanced) follows a basic outline. Perhaps, the best outline is available in the home page of w3schools.com. 

Here is a copy of that template code. 

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
    <body>

        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
    </html>

Most of the above is self explanatory. 

* DOCTYPE specifies the document type, which, in this case, is HTML.
* majority of HTML tags have an opening and closing tag. html, head and so on.
* along with the above essentials like h1 (headings) and p (paragraph) we also end up using img (for images), href (for links) and lists, a lot. 
* the best thing to do is to check the linked codepen below which demonstrates all this very nicely.

# Developer Tip 

* watch out for this tag - DEVELOPERTIP - throughout the code for some daily developer tips.

# TRIVIA 

* sure, lets put some trivia here.
* and some more, eh?

# GLOBAL TAGS USED

* TODO - all kind of standard TODO things to do. 
* DEVELOPERTIP - tips for developers.
* SECRETANDSTRINGS69 - places where secrets like API keys and other things are stored. use this add and remove secrets before committing code publicly. private repos is okay but team members trust must be considered based on company policy.
