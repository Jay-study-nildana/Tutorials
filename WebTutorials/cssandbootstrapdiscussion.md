# CSS and Bootstrap

If you have gone through my CSS chapters, you will notice that I dont go as deep as I go in other chapters. Of course, I only touch the topic to the next it is needed to do the most basic things. I am very clear with this textbook. It is meant as the 'first' stepping stone for a student who is learning web programming for the very first time. 

Over 8 years of development and learning (at this time of writing this sentence), I have noticed that CSS is just plain crazy. JavaScript is crazy too. Still, Javascript is a type of crazy that I can make some sense of. CSS, on the other hand, does not make sense. I think, ther are many reasons for this. For one thing, browsers never standardized how elements should be displayed. Different browsers followed their own rules (I think) and CSS was the worst offender. Almost every tutorial i have seen in my life, online blog posts, books, class room sessions, there is always a section on how to make something work with this specific browser, or that other browser, keeps cropping. 

Just when things were getting standardized, came the mobile phone revolution. we have that to contend as well. This made CSS even more complicated. Again, thats my opinion. 

On a related note, I think, this is why bootstrap has become synonymous with responsive design. That is why, I skim over most of CSS when I teach web programming. So, my suggestion is, you learn the basics, and I have covered what I know, in this very textbook. Then, you build upon these bare basics of CSS, just enough to make you use bootstrap. 

This way, you allow bootstrap to do the heavy lifting of HTML content presentation. You focus on your actual web app development. It is possible that you wont agree with me on this. Yet, every developer has his own style and sense about how he goes about programming. This, is mine.
