# CSS Layout

alright, this is a major topic and layout is where you will get lot of smashing foreheads and confusion. As always, i strongly recommend you use ready to use layouts, bootstrap templates and sample code. This is my personal advice.

Layouts come in a lot of shapes and sizes. I am just going to list them here. If you dont already sense it, I personally dont like working with CSS. Prefering to use pre-built templates. Still, here is the list.
