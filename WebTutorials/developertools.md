# Developer Tools

Here, I am going to talk about the standard developer tools that we use here at our company, and by extension, for this training. 

# Primary Tool - Firefox + CodePen

This entire training is run in the browser, using the faciliies provided by Codepen, and using our recommended browser, [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). We are going to assume that you know how to use Firefox. As far as codepen is concerned, we would request you to check with the video links below which cotian usage information about CodePen.

# Other Tools and services

If you dont want to use CodePen, then, we would recommend the following tools that we use at our company. Please note, everything mentioned below, each of them do one specific task. CodePen, does all the below on its own. That is why, for newcomers, we recommend CodePen. Also, because we use CodePen throughout this tutorial.

* Visual Studio Code - to develop your code. [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Node JS - To install required packages and run required tools. [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* http-server - to run your web app locally. [Download Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

* Git Tools - to interact with Git. [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Browsers - along with Firefox, it is suggested that you also have other browsers like Safari (its already installed if you are using Mac), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) and [Opera](https://www.opera.com) installed on your computer.
