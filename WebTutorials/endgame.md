# What You Will Learn - The Endgame

All said and done, when you finish this tutorial, you should be able to build some basic web apps. So, what does that mean.

Our definition of a 'basic' web developer, and what we aim to teach you, is as follows.

* Know the essential developer tools of web programming
* Working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Working knowledge of Bootstrap
* Working knoweldge of REST/JSON/WEBAPI/ENDPOINTS
* Working knowledge of Swagger/API documentation and Postman and curl.
* Consuming above mentioned API servicees in the web app
* Working knowledge of deploying the built web app into a cloud based web app service
* Working knowledge of using GitHub, Git, Repositories.
* Also, knowing what to do next, now that you have learnt the basics.

# An everyday example

Consider an API service. For example, we have a working api server, [here](https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/ProjectWTPublicRepos/tree/master/ProjectCRUD). Imagine that this is an API server that is built a company, and now, you are hired as a developer (or an intern) to build a web app. This web app will be used by customers of the company. 

So, that is your taks. Now, look at our endgame points in the above section. In order to work with company api system, you need to have a knowledge about understanding api, JSON and related things. You need to know how to use Postman and curl. Once you have understood that, next, you will need to start building your web app. 

To build your web app (again, look at our above list), you will need to know how to use developer tools of web programming. Then, you need to sit and actually code in HTML, JS, CS/Bootstrap. You will also have to know how to use GitHub and Git, because, you are probably working as part of a team. 

Lastly, these days, simply knowing basic web development, wont take you far in your career. Atmost, it will help you land your first job, or internship. Hence, you need to know, where all this is going, in the future. 

So, I hope, that gives you an idea what we are trying to do here.

# GLOBAL TAGS USED

* TODO - all kind of standard TODO things to do.
