# Folders and Files

As your project grows bigger, you will find yourself using a ton of files. Over time, you may even come up with your folder structure that suits your coding style. 

Most of the time, you will have the following folders and relevant files going inside each folder.

* images - contains all your images. you have more folders inside this for specific category of images.
* styles - contains all your css or stylesheet files.
* scripts - contains all your js or javascript files.
* html - contains all your html files. 
* index.html - the main entry point of your website. 

Please note that none of this is standard. the www is all about flexibility. You can give whatever name you want in your project. as long as you, and your project team is okay with it, it should be okay.

# Paths - Going Up and Digging Down

When working with files, you are constantly linking with files with the following three scenarios.

* you are connecting to a sibling. so, the files are next to each other in the same folder.
* going up one or more folders. the files are in a folder 'above' the current folder, and there could be multiple levels. For this, you use something like this - '../../hello.jpg' (going up two levels)
* going down one or more folders. the files are in a folder 'below' the current folder, and there could be multiple levels. For this, you use something like this - 'images/one/hello.jpg' (going down two levels)

note - if you are linking files that are hosting in the another server, then, you will simply use the full path of the file. 

for example, when using a bootstrap cdn, you will use something like this.

https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css

Paths and other things matter when you working locally using visual studio code or similar editor. If you are using codepen, that would work differently because codepen will give you a direct link to images or other files that you are using. so, this path going up and down, may not matter that much.

# TRIVIA 

* sure, lets put some trivia here.
* and some more, eh?

# GLOBAL TAGS USED

* TODO - all kind of standard TODO things to do. 
* DEVELOPERTIP - tips for developers.
* SECRETANDSTRINGS69 - places where secrets like API keys and other things are stored. use this add and remove secrets before committing code publicly. private repos is okay but team members trust must be considered based on company policy.
