# Full Web App

This is our endgame. Here, we bring together everything we have learnt till now, and build an app that you can use from any mobile, tablet or computer.

If you can do this, learn this, you are ready to start building apps that you can actually proves that you are web developer.

From here, you can try and become a server side node js developer, or react developer or any other web based developer. You can also venture into dot net, Java, Android or iOS as you have also picked up essentially programming skills that are same no matter what else you will learn in the future.

# back end and front end

Ultimate, a web app has two parts.

* back end - the API server which provides you with a place to store and get data 
* front end - this is your web app that your users access. 

For the sake of this chapter, we will use a API server that we have already built. you can find more details about our api server, [here](https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/ProjectWTPublicRepos/tree/master/ProjectCRUD) (github repo) and [here](https://projectcrudwebapiserver.azurewebsites.net/) (deployed live server).

# leave CodePen and user Visual Studio Code

If you have reached till here, that means, you have learnt most of the basics of web programming and you are serious. That means, we strongly recommend you setup your computer for visual studio code based development. 

You can still build this project on CodePen, but we will be using Visual Studio Code for this chapter.

# Less Reading More Watching and Coding Along

In this chapter, the whole thing will be done via video. My best recommendation is that you watch the app building video, on a separate monitor or display. As you watch the video, you try and build the app on your laptop or computer. 

That is the best way. If you dont have a second monitor or display, another option is to have two or more friends, form a group. Use one laptop to play the video. And, every body else in the group, try to build the app while watching the video.

# TRIVIA 

* sure, lets put some trivia here.
* and some more, eh?

# GLOBAL TAGS USED

* TODO - all kind of standard TODO things to do. 
* DEVELOPERTIP - tips for developers.
* SECRETANDSTRINGS69 - places where secrets like API keys and other things are stored. use this add and remove secrets before committing code publicly. private repos is okay but team members trust must be considered based on company policy.
