# Hello There

Welcome to the very first chapter of our web tutorial. This is just a quick note to get you started. Hope you find this textbook useful. 

# TLDR

The bullet points

* This textbook is for complete beginners who know nothing about web app development or programming or HTML or CSS or JavaScript or Bootstrap.
* I have put together a simple [web app](https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/ProjectWTPublicRepos/tree/master/apps/BariBasicsProgrammingWebApp). I want to teach you how to build that in the shortest possible time.
* That's it. 

# Philoshophy and Approach

Now, lets go over our philosophy and approach to training in this textbook, and by extension. This will be boring but we request you to go through in full.

So, here, we go. Chapter Flow - in every chapter, you will find a few common things.

* written explanation of the topic relevant to the chapter.
* video explanations (links) also discussing the same topics.
* Podcast (links) also discussing the same topics
* references to materils used
* developer tips for easier development
* other trivia as required
* link to codepen code, as relevant
* like to other repositories of our company that contains full code, that can be cloned
* link to packages used and related notes.

Now, the important thing is, you dont need to know and go through all of the above things. Most of the time, you can pick one or two (because, all the above link to each other, like a criss cross of network of channels, all doing the same thing). For instanc,in every chapter, you can just watch the videos and nothing. However, another person might prefer, going through the code, and dont want to watch videos.

Its really up to you, how you to learn and solve the problem of learning. Our job here is to give you all the options. 

# GLOBAL TAGS USED

* TODO - all kind of standard TODO things to do. 
* DEVELOPERTIP - tips for developers.
* SECRETANDSTRINGS69 - places where secrets like API keys and other things are stored. use this add and remove secrets before committing code publicly. private repos is okay but team members trust must be considered based on company policy.
