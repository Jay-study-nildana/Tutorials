# Live Classes and Video Recordings Available

In order to make this textbook even more useful, I am conducting (at the time of this writing), live classes on twitch.

You check the schedule of classes on [Twitch Profile](twitch.tv/jaylive510), and of course, participate.

Further, recordings of the live classes are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJJVulg4J7POMdX0veuacXw).

As always, more information is available at our [Learning Hub](baribasic.com), and this textbook.
