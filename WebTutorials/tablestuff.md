# Tables

every now and then, you will need to use tables. in this chapter, you will see basic table usage. 

As I have mentioned, try not to build tables on your own. Its a very costly (time consuming) affair. Its always a good idea to borrow table code that already is available online (like from bootstrap or from this chapter's codepen) and modify it to suit your needs. 

A standard table would have the following things and tags

* the table tag, of course. 
* the table row tag, tr.
* the table header tag, th.
* the table data tag, td, which contains the actual data you are trying to display

as always, check the linked codepen to see a table in action.
