# Web Forms

a web form is something that you will be building a lot. any and every app, you will be constantly asking your users to enter information. Of course, thanks to touch screens, you will be building a lot of touch based forms, and there will be text entry as well. So, forms will be a mix of touch based and also text based elements. 

A web form is also the first place you will be using all the things you have learnt so far - HTML, CSS, all the tags, tables and all that - together. So, it is important that you have gone through all the chapters till now when you reach this point.

In a typical form, you will have the following.

* input values that are collected. This can be text, numbers, drop down, selections and so on.
* you will have an action, which is aimed/targeted at your server. this is not discussed here. this information will be provided to you from your server developer. Dont worry about it right now.
* submit button that triggers an event where all the user entered data is sent over to the server as per the action.
* label tag will be used a lot. to display the visible name to tell user what you expect them to enter
* input tag is where you allow the user to enter the data. this can be of different types like text, number etc.
* form validation. this is when you validate - check if things are okay or not - when user enters a value. for example, if the input is an email box, check and update if it looks like a valid email.

# forms and HTML and JavaScript

There are some things to remember, when you look at forms. thanks to the focus on mobile usage, forms use some combination of both HTML and Javascript provided facilities to get working. for example, you can choose to validate input using HTML provided facilities which are simple. Alternatively, you may choose to do some sort of advanced validation based on input events that are then processed by linked javascript. 

Another example would be the submit button. You may use the standard form submit, or you could link the button to javascript and process the form in your own way. 

With forms, it gets all mixed up. Further, forms work best when you are doing something with a server that accepts the data. Later, when we discuss consumption of API, we will return to forms topic, and see how things really work with respect to forms.

# final note

Ultimately, in this chapter, understand how to build a basic form, without worrying too much as to how exactly it works and how data is sent over to the serve. 

You learn the form basics here. Later, when working on API consumption, you really get to the bottom of this topic.

The linked codepen has a simple form with some basic validation for you to check.
