# Web Forms - How I do - Simple Calculator

You already saw one type of web forms, [earlier](webforms.md). 

I dont actually use that style of forms and the standard submit option. I use a slightly different technique. As always, everything i try to teach in this textbook has to do with the code that i have used in the final [web app](https://baribasicswebappjune23rd2020.azurewebsites.net) demo.

# components first 

* DIV - a div holds things together. Like a grouping.
* INPUT - the tag that is used to collect input. 
* BUTTON - a button for clicking and tapping. 
* onclick - a quick and easy JavaScript function that can be used to trigger user action.
* ID - giving the input elements a unique selector item so we can collect values from the boxes.

# How would this work?

As always, the example linked code below has more details. The flow itself works like this. 

1. identify each input box with a unique ID aka selector. 
2. put a simple button and link it up with a function. 
3. in that function, that is linked, collect the values from the input boxes.
4. do what you want to do with the input in javascript using your own method.
5. display the output in the console - recommended but not mandatory.
6. display the output back on the web page.

# TRIVIA 

* sure, lets put some trivia here.
* and some more, eh?

# GLOBAL TAGS USED

* TODO - all kind of standard TODO things to do. 
* DEVELOPERTIP - tips for developers.
* SECRETANDSTRINGS69 - places where secrets like API keys and other things are stored. use this add and remove secrets before committing code publicly. private repos is okay but team members trust must be considered based on company policy.
