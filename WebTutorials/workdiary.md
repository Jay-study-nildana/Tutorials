# June 3rd 22020 - Resuming Work

Due to the pandemic ([blog post with more details](https://medium.com/@vijayasimhabr/throwing-in-the-towel-covid19-makes-me-go-full-non-work-and-lockdown-mode-85f691104566)) I stopped all of my work, including hobby projects. 

Now, slowly, getting back to it. Nothing major. Still not ready to work at full speed. Just, warming up.
